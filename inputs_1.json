For security, please enter your 4-digit PIN or say \u201cCard Security.\u201d To hear options, say \u201cHelp.\u201d How can we help you today?\n\n[09:15:22] Customer: Card Security. Hi, I\u2019m calling about some unauthorized charges on my credit card ending in 1234. My name is Alex Thompson.\n\n[09:15:34] Agent (FRA-0521): Hello, Mr. Thompson. I\u2019m Jordan with the Card Security team. I\u2019m going to help you through this. Before we proceed, I need to verify your identity. Could you confirm the last four digits of your Social Security Number and your date of birth?\n\n[09:15:51] Customer: Sure. SSN last four is 6789. Date of birth is 02/14/1986.\n\n[09:16:03] Agent: Thank you, Mr. Thompson. For your privacy, I\u2019ll ask you to confirm the billing address on file. Is that the address ending in 9021?\n\n[09:16:12] Customer: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\n\n[09:16:22] Agent: Great. I\u2019m also going to verify the card you\u2019re calling about. You mentioned unauthorized charges on the card ending in 1234, correct?\n\n[09:16:32] Customer: Yes. There are two or three charges I didn\u2019t make. One was at a gas station in Phoenix, another online at a storefront I don\u2019t recognize, and there was a small test charge that I don\u2019t recognize either.\n\n[09:16:48] Agent: I\u2019m showing two unfamiliar transactions on your card: a $92.18 charge at a gas station in Phoenix around 2:15 a.m. yesterday, and a $135.60 online purchase from a retailer called SwiftShop Online, also yesterday. There was a $8.75 \u201ctest\u201d charge that you didn\u2019t authorize?\n\n[09:17:07] Customer: Right. I didn\u2019t make any of those. I didn\u2019t even leave my apartment after 11 p.m. last night.\n\n[09:17:16] Agent: I understand this is alarming. I\u2019ll take immediate steps to protect your account. First, I\u2019ll place a temporary fraud hold on your card to prevent any new charges. Then I\u2019ll start a fraud investigation and issue you a temporary credit for the disputed transactions, if eligible, while we review. Is that acceptable?\n\n[09:17:32] Customer: Yes. Please do that. I don\u2019t want any more charges going through.\n\n[09:17:40] Agent: Thank you. I\u2019ll need to pause to set that up. One moment, please.\n\n[09:18:12] (Hold music briefly)\n\n[09:19:05] Agent: I\u2019ve placed a provisional hold on the card ending in 1234. No new purchases will be allowed until we issue a replacement card. I\u2019m also initiating a fraud investigation with our dedicated team. They\u2019ll review the transactions and determine what\u2019s legitimate.\n\n[09:19:24] Customer: Okay. Will I get my money back for these charges right away?\n\n[09:19:32] Agent: For unauthorized transactions, we typically reverse the disputed amounts once the investigation confirms fraud. We can issue provisional credits while the investigation is ongoing, but it depends on the transaction type and timing. I\u2019ve started the process to credit the two reported charges\u2014$92.18 and $135.60\u2014back to your account if they\u2019re found to be unauthorized. The third one, the small charge, is being reviewed separately. You\u2019ll see the provisional credits reflected on your statement within 24 to 48 hours if eligible.\n\n[09:19:58] Customer: That sounds good. I\u2019m worried about the online charge\u2014SwiftShop Online. I don\u2019t recall ever using that site.\n\n[09:20:10] Agent: Understood. We\u2019ll treat that as high priority. I\u2019ll trigger additional monitoring on any merchant category activity tied to your account and ensure that merchant is flagged during the investigation. If there\u2019s any risk of further unauthorized activity, we\u2019ll take immediate steps.\n\n[09:20:30] Customer: So I\u2019ll get a new card?\n\n[09:20:34] Agent: Yes. In addition to the fraud hold, we\u2019ll issue a new card with a new number. We\u2019ll mail the replacement card to your address on file. It usually takes 3\u20135 business days, though sometimes faster, depending on your location.\n\n[09:20:53] Customer: Do I need to activate it once I get it?\n\n[09:20:57] Agent: Yes. When you receive the new card, you\u2019ll need to activate it. Please destroy the old card once you\u2019ve activated the new one. For security, do not keep both active at the same time.\n\n[09:21:12] Customer: Okay. Do I need to change any online accounts or passwords?\n\n[09:21:20] Agent: It\u2019s a good precaution. Since the unauthorized charges are linked to your card, I recommend updating your online banking password, and any merchant accounts that use the compromised card information. If you\u2019d like, I can guide you through that after this call or you can handle it on your own time. We can also enable two-factor authentication for added protection.\n\n[09:21:40] Customer: I\u2019d appreciate that guidance. I\u2019m not sure where to start.\n\n[09:21:46] Agent: No problem. I\u2019ll walk you through a brief plan. After we finish with the call, you can set up 2FA on any site that supports it. We\u2019ll also send you a summary email with the case number, the charges disputed, and the next steps. Do you want me to include the email address you\u2019re using for the bank account, or is there a preferred contact?\n\n[09:22:04] Customer: The same email on file is fine.\n\n[09:22:10] Agent: Noted. Now, just to confirm, the transactions you want us to investigate are:\n- $92.18 gas purchase in Phoenix at about 2:15 a.m.\n- $135.60 SwiftShop Online purchase\n- $8.75 test charge (you said you didn\u2019t authorize)\n\nCorrect?\n\n[09:22:27] Customer: Yes, that\u2019s right. The test charge is the odd one.\n\n[09:22:34] Agent: Understood. The \u201ctest charge\u201d could be a verification attempt by the fraudster or a small charge to confirm the card works. We\u2019ll include that in our notes.\n\n[09:22:46] Customer: How long will the entire investigation take?\n\n[09:22:50] Agent: Our standard fraud investigations take up to 10 business days. Given the urgency and the number of items, we\u2019ll aim to provide a preliminary update within 3\u20135 business days. If we require more information, a fraud specialist will contact you by phone or email. Do you have a preferred contact method for updates?\n\n[09:23:11] Customer: Email is fine, but I also want calls to my phone if possible.\n\n[09:23:18] Agent: We can arrange both. I\u2019ll note you prefer calls to your mobile at (XXX) XXX-XXXX and email to your registered address. If you change your contact preference, you can call us to adjust.\n\n[09:23:35] Customer: I\u2019ll keep both. Also, will I be responsible for any of these charges?\n\n[09:23:42] Agent: Based on the information you provided and the quick reporting, you should have zero liability for unauthorized charges when reported promptly. You won\u2019t be charged for the disputed items while the investigation is underway. If there were any fraudulent charges processed after you reported, they would be reversed. We\u2019ll monitor for any other suspicious activity and alert you immediately.\n\n[09:24:04] Customer: That\u2019s a relief. What do you need from me next?\n\n[09:24:11] Agent: At this point, I have what I need to start the investigation. I will transfer you to the fraud investigation queue for ongoing monitoring and updates, and we\u2019ll also coordinate with the card re-issue team for your replacement card. If you have any more transactions you didn\u2019t authorize that you recall after today, let us know so we can add them to the investigation.\n\n[09:24:33] Customer: I\u2019ll check my statements daily and report anything else.\n\n[09:24:41] Agent: Excellent. I\u2019ll stay with you for a moment while I note the case details in our system. The main items in this case GRB-20251024-001234 are:\n- Card held and new card to be issued\n- Two disputed transactions with provisional credits\n- One unknown test charge under review\n- Identity verification completed\n- Fraud investigation opened and ongoing\n- Preferred contact methods set to email and mobile\n\n[09:25:12] Customer: Okay, I think that covers it for now.\n\n[09:25:18] Agent: Before we finish, is there anything else you\u2019d like to add? Any other recent activity you\u2019ve noticed or concerns about other accounts?\n\n[09:25:30] Customer: No, not today. But I did notice one recurring charge that I didn\u2019t authorize on a different card a few months ago. It stopped after I called last year, but I\u2019m worried it could happen again if I don\u2019t get this all checked.\n\n[09:25:46] Agent: I\u2019m glad you mentioned that. We can review other accounts and monitor for similar patterns if you\u2019d like. We can set alerts on unusual merchant activity, or place additional restrictions on other cards in your name. Would you like me to set those up?\n\n[09:26:04] Customer: Yes, please. Let\u2019s set up alerts on all cards and make sure my other primary card has enhanced monitoring for a while.\n\n[09:26:12] Agent: I\u2019ve updated your profile to enable enhanced monitoring across all linked cards and turned on alerting for unusual merchant activity. You\u2019ll receive a notification if anything looks suspicious. I\u2019ll also flag your other cards for potential freeze if unauthorized use is detected.\n\n[09:26:28] Customer: That sounds good. I appreciate the extra protection.\n\n[09:26:33] Agent: One more thing: I\u2019ll email you a detailed summary of today\u2019s call, the disputed charges, the case number, and the next steps. You\u2019ll see it within a few minutes to an hour, depending on server load.\n\n[09:26:49] Customer: Great. I\u2019ll look out for it.\n\n[09:26:56] Agent: I\u2019ll now close out this portion of the call. If you don\u2019t hear from us with an update in a few minutes, you can check your email or call back using the case number GRB-20251024-001234 for the latest status.\n\n[09:27:12] Customer: Thank you, Jordan. I feel better knowing you\u2019re handling this.\n\n[09:27:18] Agent: You\u2019re very welcome, Mr. Thompson. I know this is stressful, and we\u2019re here to help. You\u2019ve taken the right steps to protect your accounts.\n\n[09:27:29] Customer: I appreciate it. Could you also remind me how I can check the status online?\n\n[09:27:35] Agent: Of course. You can log in to Granite Ridge Bank Online and select the Fraud & Security tab. There you\u2019ll find the current case GRB-20251024-001234, the status, any provisional credits, and expected timelines.

If you\u2019d like me to rephrase or add anything, just tell me.\n\n[09:28:18] Customer: No, that covers it. Thanks again.\n\n[09:28:22] Agent: You\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m going to finalize the case now. Thank you for calling Granite Ridge Bank. Have a safe day, Mr. Thompson.\n\n[09:28:32] Customer: You too.
